# Date For Morpheus Fair Launch - February 8th 2024
Following successful audits and testnet deployments, smart contracts for the Morpheus (MOR) token and its fair launch were deployed to Ethereum and Arbitrum mainnet on February 7th 2024.  
The fair launch commenced on February 8th for Code and Capital contributors, as per the bootstrapping schedule outlined below.

## Bootstrapping Period Phase 1: Code & Capital
The Smart Contracts began allocating MOR token emissions for Code, Capital, Compute, and Community from day 1. Keep in mind MOR tokens are not be claimable or transferrable until day 91 after phase 1 of the bootstrapping period which is May 8th.

## Bootstrapping Period Phase 2: Compute
While rewards for Compute contributors began accruing on day 1, they will not be distributed until the Compute Router and other details are developed by the community.

## Bootstrapping Period Phase 3: Community Front End Builders
Similarly, rewards for Community (frontend) contributors began accruing on day 1, but will not be distributed until distribution details are developed by the community.

## Bootstrapping Period Phase 4: Adding More Chains / Yield Types
As Morpheus is intended to be chain-agnostic, it is worth considering proposals to deploy the MOR token on other chains and provision yield (with eligibility for Capital rewards) from other sources.

- Examples of cross-chain deployments could entail using Wormhole or LayerZero to move MOR tokens between ETH, ARB, POLY, Solana, and the Cosmos chains.
- Examples of alternative yield sources could include BTC yield from Thorchain or mSOL from Solana.

These are significant and interrelated projects as adding yield sources necessitates adding the MOR token to other chains in a way where cross-chain messaging is possible. 

## Updated Testing Plan
Outlined here is the testing plan the Morpheus Smart Contracts were subject to before launch:

## History
February 8th 2024 is the 28th Anniversary of "A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace" (February 8th 1996). 
Seems like a good day to release Decentralized AI into the world.
