# Compute Contributions 

Compute contributions will be available after the bootstrapping period. The Lumerin model as pioneered by Ryan Condron of Lumerin is being incorporated into Morpheus. More information can be found in the resources below. 

## Morpheus Lumerin Model Lightpaper

  Ryan founded Lumerin as a response to Bitcoin's centralization issue in mining, aiming to create a decentralized hashpower routing system. The architecture of Lumerin, which emphasizes decentralization, transparency, and efficiency, serves as a solid foundation for the Morpheus node. By adopting the principles and design patterns established in Lumerin, Morpheus inherits the benefits of decentralization, such as increased security, reduced risk of manipulation or censorship, and improved scalability.

## Morpheus Lumerin Model  

The Morpheus Lumerin Model utilizes the Lumerin protocol routing pattern to create a peer-to-peer, decentralized, and anonymous ecosystem for connecting AI users with AI model and agent compute providers. This model seeks to incorporate aspects of the original Morpheus white paper and yellow paper as well as core concepts from the Yellowstone Compute Model and Lake Travis System.
The below proposal explains the key design principles that have been incorporated as well as outline each part of the on-chain ecosystem model, client-side node, and underlying protocol.
